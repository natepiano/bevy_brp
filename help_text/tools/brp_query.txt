Query entities using the bevy/query BRP method. This powerful tool allows you to search for entities based on their components, applying filters and returning component data. This tool wraps the bevy/query method for easier use.

This is useful for:
- Finding all entities with specific component combinations
- Retrieving component data from matching entities
- Filtering entities based on presence/absence of components
- Debugging entity-component relationships in your Bevy app

Parameters:
- data (object): Specifies what component data to retrieve
  - components: Array of component types to include in results
  - option: Array of optional components (won't fail if missing)
  - has: Array of components that must exist (but aren't returned)
- filter (object): Filters which entities to query
  - with: Array of components entities must have
  - without: Array of components entities must NOT have
- strict (boolean): If true, query fails on unknown component types

Example usage patterns:
1. Find all entities with Transform and return their data
2. Find entities with Camera component, returning Transform data
3. Find entities with Sprite but without Player component

IMPORTANT: Components must be registered with BRP (see brp_list_components for requirements).
