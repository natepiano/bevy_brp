Capture a screenshot from a running Bevy application. This tool uses bevy_brp_extras to save the current frame buffer to a file.

This is useful for:
- Capturing app state for debugging or documentation
- Creating automated screenshots for testing
- Generating visual records of app behavior
- Building screenshot-based testing workflows

Parameters:
- path (required): File path where the screenshot should be saved
- port (optional): BRP port to connect to (default: 15702)

Screenshot behavior:
- Calls bevy_brp_extras/screenshot to capture the current frame
- Saves the image to the specified path
- Supports common image formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- Path must be writable by the Bevy application

Return values:
- status: "success" if screenshot was captured, "error" if failed
- path: The file path where the screenshot was saved
- port: The port that was used
- message: Description of what happened or error details

Prerequisites:
- Your Bevy app must include bevy_brp_extras as a dependency
- The BrpExtrasPlugin must be registered in your app
- The app must have a camera and rendering pipeline active

IMPORTANT: This tool requires bevy_brp_extras - it will not work with standard BRP alone. If bevy_brp_extras is not available, the tool will return an error with instructions on how to add it.
