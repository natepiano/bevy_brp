Toggle debug mode to control whether format discovery debug information is included in BRP responses.

Parameters:
- enabled (required): true to include debug_info field in responses, false to exclude it

When enabled, adds a debug_info field containing messages about the format discovery process to all BRP responses (both success and error).

This is mostly useful in development of the bevy_brp_mcp tool itself as it's challenging to capture its stdout when it is being run by a coding agent as an mcp server.
