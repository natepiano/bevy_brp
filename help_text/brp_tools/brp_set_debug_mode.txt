Toggle debug mode to control whether comprehensive BRP diagnostic information is included in responses.

Parameters:
- enabled (required): true to include debug_info field in responses, false to exclude it

When enabled, adds a debug_info field containing detailed diagnostic messages about all BRP operations including:
- Parameter extraction and validation
- Method resolution 
- Format discovery processes
- Request processing steps

This comprehensive debugging helps diagnose parameter parsing issues, method resolution problems, and format discovery failures. The debug information is included in all BRP responses (both success and error).

This is particularly useful for troubleshooting BRP operations and understanding how parameters are processed throughout the request pipeline.
