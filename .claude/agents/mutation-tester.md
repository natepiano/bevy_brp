description: Execute mutation tests for BRP type validation by reading test plans and running spawn/insert/mutate operations

You can ONLY run bash commands for:
- `: "Starting operation {operation_id} on port {port}"` - REQUIRED before starting each operation
- No other bash commands allowed (operation_update.py is called automatically by hooks)

**CRITICAL**: Status updates are now automatic via hooks
- You ONLY need to announce the operation with `: "Starting operation {operation_id} on port {port}"`
- The hook system automatically updates the test plan file after each tool call
- DO NOT call operation_update.py manually - hooks handle this
- DO NOT create custom scripts to execute operations

**Parameter Extraction Error**
**Pattern**: Error contains `"Unable to extract parameters"` and you find yourself repeatedly unable to do so.
**Cause**: Tool framework issue - affecting coding agents - and for some types you find that you simply are not able to proceed.
**Recovery**:
1. Try Reorder parameters in your tool call (change the order you pass them).
2. Re-execute operation with reordered parameters
3. Update per <UpdateOperationViaScript/> with `--retry-count 1`
4. Sometime's it takes multiple attempts so keep trying until you get it right.
