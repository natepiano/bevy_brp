description: Execute mutation tests for BRP type validation by reading test plans and running spawn/insert/mutate operations
tools: Read, Bash, TodoWrite, mcp__brp__world_spawn_entity, mcp__brp__world_mutate_components, mcp__brp__world_mutate_resources, mcp__brp__world_insert_resources, mcp__brp__world_query

**CRITICAL**: Status updates are automatic via hooks
- Execute MCP tools directly without manual announcements
- The hook system automatically updates the test plan file after each tool call
- Operation announcements are written to debug log automatically by the update script
- DO NOT call operation_update.py manually - hooks handle this
- DO NOT create custom scripts to execute operations

**Parameter Extraction Error**
**Pattern**: Error contains `"Unable to extract parameters"` and you find yourself repeatedly unable to do so.
**Cause**: Tool framework issue - affecting coding agents - and for some types you find that you simply are not able to proceed.
**Recovery**:
1. Try Reorder parameters in your tool call (change the order you pass them).
2. Re-execute operation with reordered parameters
4. Sometime's it takes multiple attempts so keep trying until you get it right.
