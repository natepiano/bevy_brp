# Create Mutation Test JSON File

**CRITICAL** before doing anything else, read the tagged sections below and use them where referenced.

**DIRECTORY VALIDATION**: Ensure you are in the correct working directory before starting:
```bash
if [[ ! -f ".claude/commands/create_mutation_test_json.md" ]]; then
    echo "❌ Not in bevy_brp root directory. Please cd to the project root."
    exit 1
fi
```

[APP_PORT]: 22222
[APP_NAME]: extras_plugin
</CreateContext>

<CreateKeywords>
    **For validation decisions:**
    - **promote**: Mark this version as the new good baseline
    - **skip**: Keep existing baseline, don't promote this version
    - **investigate**: Launch deeper investigation of the differences

</CreateKeywords>

<KeywordExecution>
    **CRITICAL**: Follow tagged procedures for all execution steps.

    **promote**: Mark version as baseline:
    ```bash
    .claude/scripts/create_mutation_test_json_promote_baseline.sh
    ```
    **skip**: Keep existing baseline, document decision, continue
    **investigate**: Ask user "What specific aspect would you like me to investigate?", then launch Task tool with their focus
    **comparison_review**:
    1. Generate detailed comparison data:
       ```bash
       .claude/scripts/create_mutation_test_json_structured_comparison.sh --detailed .claude/types/all_types_baseline.json .claude/types/all_types.json
       ```
    2. Read the detailed output:
       ```bash
       Read tool: $TMPDIR/mutation_comparison_details.json
       ```
    3. Create todos for each unexpected change pattern identified
    4. For each pattern with examples in the details file:
       - Select representative type/mutation path from the examples
       - Extract the actual JSON using:
         ```bash
         # Get from baseline
         .claude/scripts/get_mutation_path.sh "[TYPE_NAME]" "[MUTATION_PATH]" .claude/types/all_types_baseline.json
         # Get from current
         .claude/scripts/get_mutation_path.sh "[TYPE_NAME]" "[MUTATION_PATH]" .claude/types/all_types.json
         ```
    5. Format the comparison using <FormatComparison/> and present to user with pattern context
    6. Wait for user response before proceeding to next pattern
    7. Stop when user says to stop or all patterns reviewed
    **check_type**: Ask user "Which type would you like me to check?", then execute:
    ```bash
    python3 .claude/scripts/compare_mutations_check_type.py "[TYPE_NAME]"
    ```
    **summarize**: Ask user "Which JSON file would you like me to summarize?", then execute:
    ```bash
    .claude/scripts/compare_mutations_summarize.sh [JSON_FILE]
    ```

## MAIN WORKFLOW

<ExecutionSteps>
    **EXECUTE THESE STEPS IN ORDER:**

    **STEP 1:** Execute the <AppLaunch/> → **STOP** and verify success before proceeding
    **STEP 2:** Execute the <TypeDiscovery/> → **STOP** and verify success before proceeding
    **STEP 3:** Execute the <FileTransformation/> → **STOP** and verify success before proceeding
    **STEP 4:** Execute the <AppCleanup/> → **STOP** and verify success before proceeding
    **STEP 5:** Execute the <ComparisonValidation/> → **STOP** and verify success before proceeding
    **STEP 6:** Execute the <UserValidation/> → **STOP** and present final summary
</ExecutionSteps>

## STEP 1: APP LAUNCH

<AppLaunch>
    Launch the extras_plugin app on the designated port:

    1. **Launch Example**:
    ```bash
    mcp__brp__brp_launch_bevy_example(
        example_name="[APP_NAME]",
        port=[APP_PORT]
    )
    ```

    2. **Verify BRP connectivity**:
    ```bash
    mcp__brp__brp_status(
        app_name="[APP_NAME]",
        port=[APP_PORT]
    )
    ```

    **VALIDATION**: Confirm both launch and BRP status are successful before proceeding to Step 2.

    **STOP** - Do not proceed until both confirmations are received.
</AppLaunch>

## STEP 2: TYPE DISCOVERY

<TypeDiscovery>
    Get all type guides using the comprehensive discovery tool:

    Call `brp_all_type_guides` to get type guides for all registered types in one operation:
    ```bash
    mcp__brp__brp_all_type_guides(port=[APP_PORT])
    ```

    This automatically discovers all registered types and returns their type guides. The tool will save its result to a file and return the filepath (e.g., `/var/folders/.../mcp_response_brp_all_type_guides_12345.json`).

    **VALIDATION**: Confirm the tool returned a valid filepath and type count.

    **CRITICAL**: Note the returned filepath for use in Step 3.

    **STOP** - Do not proceed until filepath is confirmed.
</TypeDiscovery>

## STEP 3: FILE TRANSFORMATION

<FileTransformation>
    Augment the BRP response with test metadata while preserving FULL TYPE GUIDES:

    Execute the augmentation script:
    ```bash
    .claude/scripts/create_mutation_test_json_augment_response.sh [FILEPATH] [TARGET_FILE]
    ```

    Replace `[FILEPATH]` with the actual path from Step 2 and `[TARGET_FILE]` with the target location from <CreateContext/>.

    The script augments the full BRP response with test metadata for each type:
    - Preserves ALL original type guide data (mutation_paths with examples, spawn_format, etc.)
    - Adds: batch_number: null
    - Adds: test_status: "untested" (or "passed" for auto-pass types)
    - Adds: fail_reason: ""

    **File Structure**: The file is the COMPLETE BRP response with added test fields

    Expected characteristics:
    - Complete type guides with spawn_format including examples
    - Complete mutation_paths as objects with path keys and example values
    - All test metadata fields added (test_status, batch_number, fail_reason)
    - Full preservation of schema_info, supported_operations, reflection traits

    **VALIDATION**: Confirm the script completed successfully and target file was created.

    **CRITICAL**: This maintains complete fidelity with BRP responses, storing actual examples for reproducible testing

    **STOP** - Do not proceed until file creation is confirmed.
</FileTransformation>

## STEP 4: APP CLEANUP

<AppCleanup>
    Shutdown the application:

    ```bash
    mcp__brp__brp_shutdown(
        app_name="[APP_NAME]",
        port=[APP_PORT]
    )
    ```

    **VALIDATION**: Confirm the app has been cleanly shutdown before proceeding.

    **STOP** - Do not proceed until shutdown is confirmed.
</AppCleanup>

## STEP 5: COMPARISON AND VALIDATION

<ComparisonValidation>
    **Automatic Comparison with Baseline**

    After successful file creation, automatically compare with baseline:

    **CRITICAL FILE MANAGEMENT**:
    - DO NOT create backup copies or intermediate files
    - DO NOT use `cp` to create `all_types_previous.json` or any other files
    - ONLY read existing files for comparison
    - The comparison is ALWAYS between:
      - BASELINE: `.claude/types/all_types_baseline.json` (the known good baseline)
      - CURRENT: `.claude/types/all_types.json` (the newly created file from Step 3)

    **Run structured comparison directly**:
    ```bash
    .claude/scripts/create_mutation_test_json_structured_comparison.sh .claude/types/all_types_baseline.json .claude/types/all_types.json
    ```

    This comprehensive comparison provides:
    - Binary identity check with early exit if identical
    - Structured metadata analysis (type counts, spawn support, mutations)
    - Type-level change detection (modified, new, removed types)
    - **Deep structural analysis** when changes are detected:
      - Categorizes changes into known patterns (enum representation, vec format, etc.)
      - Identifies unknown patterns that need investigation
      - Shows specific paths and examples of what changed
    - Clear recommendations based on the type of changes found

    **VALIDATION**: Confirm the comparison script completed and generated output.

    **STOP** - Do not proceed until comparison output is available.
</ComparisonValidation>

## STEP 6: USER VALIDATION

<UserValidation>
    **STEP 6A: CATEGORIZE CHANGES**

    **Automatically categorize changes using the expected changes JSON**:

    The comparison script now handles categorization internally:
    ```bash
    .claude/scripts/create_mutation_test_json_structured_comparison.sh .claude/types/all_types_baseline.json .claude/types/all_types.json
    ```

    This will automatically:
    - Run the structured comparison
    - Display the comparison results
    - If expected changes file exists, run categorization and output:
      - `expected_matches`: Changes that match expected patterns with their IDs and counts
      - `unexpected_patterns`: Changes that don't match any expected pattern or are below thresholds

    **STEP 6B: PRESENT SUMMARY**

    Present the final summary using the exact template below:

    The comparison script now provides all statistics including excluded types. Extract and present them in this format:

## Mutation Test File Generation Complete
- **File created**: [TARGET_FILE]
- **Types registered in Bevy**: [extract from comparison output]
- **Spawn-supported types**: [extract from comparison output]
- **Types with mutations**: [extract from comparison output]
- **Total mutation paths**: [extract from comparison output]
- **Excluded types**: [extract from comparison output]

### Comparison with Baseline:
[Present the comparison results including:
 - If files are identical: Simple confirmation
 - If metadata only differs: Count differences
 - If structural changes exist: Full deep analysis output with two sections:]

   #### Expected Changes:
   [Use the categorization JSON output to list each matched expected change:
    - Expected Change #N: [Name from expected_matches]
    - Occurrences: [count from expected_matches]
    - Types Affected: [if available from expected_matches]]

   #### Unexpected Changes (need review):
   [Use the categorization JSON output to list unexpected patterns:
    - Pattern: [from unexpected_patterns]
    - Occurrences: [count]
    - Types Affected: [count if available]
    - Reason: [why it's unexpected from the JSON output]]

   [IF NO unexpected_patterns in JSON: State "None - all detected patterns map to expected changes"]

    **STEP 6C: PRESENT DECISION PROMPT**

### Baseline Promotion Decision
Based on the comparison results above, should I mark this version as the new good baseline?

## Available Actions
- **promote** - Mark this version as the new good baseline
- **skip** - Keep existing baseline, don't promote this version
- **investigate** - Launch deeper investigation of the differences
- **comparison_review** - Show actual JSON examples for each unexpected change pattern, one type at a time, for user examination and testing decisions

    **CRITICAL**: STOP and wait for user's keyword response before proceeding.

    **Note**: Use the keyword from Available Actions - do not continue with detailed analysis unless user specifically requests **comparison_review** or **investigate**.
</UserValidation>

## SHARED DEFINITIONS

<FormatComparison>
**Format the side-by-side JSON comparison with proper syntax highlighting:**

When presenting JSON comparisons, use this exact format with proper markdown JSON code blocks:

```json
// BASELINE
{
  "field_name": "value",
  "nested": {
    "data": [...]
  }
}
```

```json
// CURRENT
{
  "field_name": "new_value",
  "nested": {
    "data": [...]
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL**:
- Use separate ```json code blocks for BASELINE and CURRENT
- Include // BASELINE and // CURRENT comments inside the code blocks
- Use proper JSON formatting with correct indentation
- Use [...] or {...} to abbreviate unchanged nested content
- Add inline comments with // <-- to highlight key differences
</FormatComparison>

<NoIntermediateFiles>
**NO intermediate files** - Do NOT create Python scripts, temp files, or any other files beyond the target file
</NoIntermediateFiles>

**Direct tool usage only** - Use only MCP tools and the provided shell scripts
</DirectToolsOnly>

<SingleOutputFile>
**Single output file** - Only create/modify the target file specified in <CreateContext/>
