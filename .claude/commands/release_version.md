# Release Command - cargo-release Integration

**Migration Strategy: Phased**

Perform a coordinated release for bevy_brp workspace crates using cargo-release. This command handles the 3-crate dependency chain and ensures safe publishing to crates.io.

## Usage
- `/release X.Y.Z-rc.N` - Release all 3 crates as RC version (e.g., `0.3.0-rc.1`)
- `/release X.Y.Z` - Release all 3 crates as final version (e.g., `0.3.0`)

**Note: After initial release to crates.io**
Once all three crates are published on crates.io with proper version dependencies (not path dependencies), future releases can use the simplified `cargo publish --workspace` workflow. See "Future Releases (Post-Initial)" section below.

## Crate Dependency Chain
1. `mcp_macros` (no dependencies) - must be released first
2. `extras` (depends on bevy only) - can be released with mcp
3. `mcp` (depends on mcp_macros only) - released after mcp_macros is live

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting the release, verify:
1. You're on the `main` branch
2. Working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)
3. You're up to date with remote
4. cargo-release is installed (`cargo install cargo-release`)

<ArgumentValidation>
## Argument Validation and VERSION Setup

**First, capture VERSION from arguments:**
```bash
VERSION="$ARGUMENTS"
```

**Then validate the version format:**
```bash
bash .claude/scripts/release_version_validate.sh "${VERSION}"
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if version is valid format, stop with clear error if invalid

**Confirm VERSION is set correctly:**
```bash
echo "Release version set to: ${VERSION}"
```

**Note**: The VERSION variable is now available for all subsequent commands in this release process.
</ArgumentValidation>

## Step 0: One-Time Repository Setup (if not already done)

**Update repository URLs to use workspace inheritance:**

```bash
# Add workspace.package section to root Cargo.toml
```
→ **Manual edit**: Add this to `/Users/natemccoy/rust/bevy_brp/Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[workspace.package]
repository = "https://github.com/natepiano/bevy_brp"
```

```bash
# Update each crate to use workspace inheritance
```
→ **Manual edit**: In each crate's Cargo.toml (mcp_macros, mcp, extras), replace repository field with:
```toml
[package]
repository.workspace = true
```

<ThreePhaseReleaseProcess>
## Three-Phase Release Process

Execute <Phase1ReleaseMcpMacros/>
Execute <Phase2UpdateMcpDependency/>
Execute <Phase3ReleaseExtrasAndMcp/>
</ThreePhaseReleaseProcess>

<Phase1ReleaseMcpMacros>
### Phase 1: Release mcp_macros

**Note**: Phase 1 uses --no-tag to skip tag creation. Tags are created in Phase 3 after all crates are ready.

```bash
cargo release ${VERSION} --package bevy_brp_mcp_macros --no-tag
```
→ **Manual verification**: Review the dry run output - version bumps, CHANGELOG updates, git operations all look correct
  - Type **continue** to proceed with release execution
  - Type **stop** to halt process for manual review

```bash
cargo release ${VERSION} --package bevy_brp_mcp_macros --no-tag --execute
```
→ **Manual verification**: Release completed successfully, git commit created (no tag)
  - Type **continue** to proceed to next phase
  - Type **stop** to halt and investigate issues

```bash
git push origin main
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if push succeeds, stop if fails

```bash
cargo publish -p bevy_brp_mcp_macros --dry-run
```
→ **Manual verification**: Review package contents, ensure all files included, no errors
  - Type **continue** to proceed with publishing
  - Type **stop** to halt and fix package issues

```bash
cargo publish -p bevy_brp_mcp_macros
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if publish succeeds, stop if fails
</Phase1ReleaseMcpMacros>

<Phase2UpdateMcpDependency>
### Phase 2: Update mcp Dependency

**Wait ~1 minute for mcp_macros to be available on crates.io**

```bash
curl -s https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/bevy_brp_mcp_macros | jq '.crate.max_version'
```
→ **Manual verification**: Shows the version you just published
  - Type **continue** to proceed with dependency update
  - Type **retry** to check again after waiting
- If null or incorrect, wait 10-20 seconds and try again

**Update mcp/Cargo.toml dependency from path to version:**

**I will edit `mcp/Cargo.toml` to change:**
```toml
# FROM:
bevy_brp_mcp_macros = { path = "../mcp_macros" }

# TO (example for version 0.3.0):
bevy_brp_mcp_macros = "0.3.0"
```
→ **I will make this edit using the actual ${VERSION} value**

**After the edit, verify it builds:**
```bash
cargo build --package bevy_brp_mcp
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if build succeeds, stop if fails

```bash
cargo nextest run --package bevy_brp_mcp
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if tests pass, stop if any fail

```bash
git add mcp/Cargo.toml && git commit -m "chore: update mcp_macros dependency to crates.io version ${VERSION}"
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if commit succeeds
</Phase2UpdateMcpDependency>

<Phase3ReleaseExtrasAndMcp>
### Phase 3: Release extras and mcp

**Note**: Phase 3 creates the version tag (v${VERSION}) since all crates are now ready.

```bash
cargo release ${VERSION} --workspace --exclude bevy_brp_mcp_macros
```
→ **Manual verification**: Review output - both extras and mcp will be released together, tag will be created
  - Type **continue** to proceed with workspace release
  - Type **stop** to halt and review changes

```bash
cargo release ${VERSION} --workspace --exclude bevy_brp_mcp_macros --execute
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if release succeeds with tag created, stop if errors
</Phase3ReleaseExtrasAndMcp>

```bash
gh release create "v${VERSION}" \
  --repo natepiano/bevy_brp \
  --title "bevy_brp v${VERSION}" \
  --notes "Combined release notes from all three crates"
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if release created successfully, stop if fails
</CreateGitHubRelease>

<PostReleaseVerification>
## Post-Release Verification

```bash
for crate in bevy_brp_mcp_macros bevy_brp_extras bevy_brp_mcp; do
  echo -n "$crate: "
  curl -s "https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/$crate" | jq '.crate.max_version'
done
```
→ **Manual verification**: All three show version ${VERSION}
  - Type **continue** to proceed with installation test

</PostReleaseVerification>

<PrepareNextReleaseCycle>
## Prepare for Next Release

→ **I will add [Unreleased] sections to all three CHANGELOG.md files**

```bash
git add mcp_macros/CHANGELOG.md extras/CHANGELOG.md mcp/CHANGELOG.md
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if successful

```bash
git commit -m "chore: prepare CHANGELOGs for next release cycle"
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if commit succeeds, stop if fails

```bash
git push origin main
```
→ **Auto-check**: Continue if push succeeds, stop if fails
</PrepareNextReleaseCycle>

## Rollback Instructions

If something goes wrong after pushing but before publishing:

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d "v${VERSION}"

# Delete remote tag
git push origin ":refs/tags/v${VERSION}"

# Revert the version bump commits (may be multiple commits)
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD  # Adjust range as needed
git push origin main
```

## Configuration Notes

The workspace uses `release.toml` with:
- `shared-version = true` for synchronized releases
- Tag format: `v{{version}}`
- Pre-release hook runs `cargo build --all`
- Manual push/publish for safety
- Test apps excluded via `[package.metadata.release] release = false`

## Design Review Skip Notes

### DESIGN-4: Limited Error Recovery Mechanisms - **Verdict**: CONFIRMED
- **Status**: SKIPPED
- **Location**: Section: Rollback Instructions
- **Issue**: Rollback instructions only cover post-push scenarios. No recovery mechanisms for failures during the multi-phase release process.
- **Reasoning**: While the finding correctly identifies gaps in error recovery procedures for each phase of the release process, the current documentation is sufficient.
- **Decision**: User elected to skip this recommendation - will figure out recovery if failures happen as this isn't that complex of a process

## Future Releases (Post-Initial)

**After the first release establishes all crates on crates.io:**

Once the initial release is complete, future releases can use the simplified Rust 1.90.0+ workflow. However, this workflow is **ONLY for release time**, not for development.

### Simplified Process
1. **Update to version dependencies** (temporarily for release):
   ```bash
   # Edit mcp/Cargo.toml: change path to version dependency
   # FROM: bevy_brp_mcp_macros = { path = "../mcp_macros" }
   # TO:   bevy_brp_mcp_macros = "0.3.0"  # previous version
   ```

2. **Version Management**: Use cargo-release for version bumps and CHANGELOG updates
   ```bash
   cargo release ${VERSION} --workspace --no-publish --execute
   ```

3. **Publishing**: Use native workspace publishing (automatically handles dependency order)
   ```bash
   cargo publish --workspace --dry-run
   cargo publish --workspace
   ```

4. **Restore path dependencies** (for development):
   ```bash
   # Edit mcp/Cargo.toml back to path dependency
   # FROM: bevy_brp_mcp_macros = "0.3.0"
   # TO:   bevy_brp_mcp_macros = { path = "../mcp_macros" }
   git add mcp/Cargo.toml
   git commit -m "chore: restore path dependency for development"
   git push origin main
   ```

This eliminates the complex 3-phase process. The native `cargo publish --workspace` (available since Rust 1.90.0) automatically:
- Determines correct publishing order based on dependencies
- Verifies the entire workspace builds with to-be-published versions
- Publishes all crates in the correct sequence

### Prerequisites for Simplified Workflow
- All crates must already exist on crates.io
- `mcp/Cargo.toml` temporarily uses version dependency for release process
- Path dependencies are restored after release for local development
- Rust toolchain version 1.90.0 or later

### Why Path Dependencies for Development?
Path dependencies are essential for development because they allow you to:
- Test changes to mcp_macros immediately in the mcp crate
- Make coordinated changes across crates without publishing
- Iterate quickly without crates.io round-trips

## Common Issues

1. **"Version already exists"**: The version is already published on crates.io
2. **"Uncommitted changes"**: Run `git status` and commit or stash changes
3. **"Not on main branch"**: Switch to main with `git checkout main`
4. **Build failures**: Fix any compilation errors before releasing
5. **Dependency chain**: Always publish mcp_macros → extras → mcp
6. **Path dependency**: Ensure mcp/Cargo.toml uses crates.io version of mcp_macros, not path
