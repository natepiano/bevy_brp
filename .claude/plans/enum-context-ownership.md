# Enum Context Ownership Analysis

## `mcp/src/brp_tools/brp_type_guide/mutation_path_builder/builder.rs` - `process_all_children`

### The "DO NOTHING" Case for Nested Enums

**Key Insight**: The system uses **two-phase processing** - downward recursion and upward assembly.

#### The Code
```rust
// Lines 226-239 in process_all_children
_ => {
    // Check if parent has enum context
    match &ctx.enum_context {
        Some(_) => {
            // We're inside another enum - don't set enum context
            // for simple example
        }
        None => {
            // Not inside an enum - this enum gets Root treatment
            child_ctx.enum_context = Some(EnumContext::Root);
        }
    }
}
```

#### When This Applies
- Parent enum has `EnumContext::Root`
- Child field is detected as an enum type
- Code deliberately sets **no enum context** for the child

#### Why This Works (Two-Phase Processing)

**Phase 1: Downward Recursion (depth-first)**
- Child enum reaches `enum_path_builder::process_enum` with `enum_context = None`
- Gets treated as Root (not inside another enum from its own perspective)
- **Generates its own full examples array** for mutation path discoverability
- Processes its own children recursively

**Phase 2: Upward Assembly (post-order)**
- Parent enum is building its own examples
- Needs a concrete value for the child enum field
- Takes child's **assembled concrete value** (not the examples array)
- Embeds this simple value in parent's example

#### The Result
- **Child enum**: Gets full examples array for its own mutation paths
- **Parent enum**: Gets clean examples using concrete child values
- **Both preserve discoverability**: Each enum's variants are discoverable at their own level

#### Rationale for "DO NOTHING"
The comment "for simple example" refers to the **assembly phase** - parent doesn't embed child's complex examples array, just uses concrete values. This prevents deeply nested example complexity while preserving individual enum functionality.

**This design successfully balances:**
- Complete mutation path generation (each enum gets proper examples)
- Clean parent example assembly (no nested complexity)
- Full discoverability (all variants accessible at appropriate levels)
