Attempting to mutate array element paths like .sorted_entities[0] fails with 'The list accessed doesn't have index `0`'.

Bevy registered Range<f32> for reflection but not ReflectDeserialize, causing deserialization error: 'type core::ops::Range<f32> did not register the ReflectDeserialize type data'. This makes Option<Viewport>::Some a PartiallyMutable variant that cannot be set via mutations, rendering child mutation paths like .viewport.0.physical_position unreachable. Path builder generates these paths but they fail with 'Expected variant index access to access a Tuple variant, found a Unit variant instead' because root_example uses None variant."

Camera components require complete camera setup (Camera, Transform, render targets) that cannot be properly initialized via dynamic spawn."

Can only safely spawn new entities with arbitrary values (no immediate crash), but mutations on existing entities with active render dependencies cause app crash on next render frame. Not suitable for mutation testing since we can't mutate existing entities, only newly spawned ones - this doesn't test general mutation behavior."

Setting arbitrary values (e.g., 1) causes the render system to panic when it tries to use the non-existent texture view on the next frame. Similarly, RenderTarget::Window expects a valid window entity, and RenderTarget::Image requires a valid image handle. These resources cannot be created via BRP, making all mutable variants unsafe to test with arbitrary example values."
