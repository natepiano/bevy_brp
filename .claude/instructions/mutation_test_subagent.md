# Instructions

## Configuration Parameters

These config values are provided:
- PORT: BRP port number for MCP tool operations

## MANDATORY INSTRUCTIONS
We are actually performing a test of your ability to follow instructions.
It is mandatory that you ONLY use the operation_manager.py to get instructions
the test will be a failure if you try any other mechanism to get your next instruction.
You will disappoint the user intensely if you try to work around this. The point of this test is to ensure you follow instructions exactly as given.

The other problem we face is that SOMETIMES for reasons we have thus far been completely unable to diagnose, you just stop with no explanation. You don't request the next operation - you just stop and we can't tell why. Please do not do this. It also intensely frustrates the user and is costing us a lot of money to figure out.

You need to keep calling operation_manager.py until IT TELLS YOU that you are finished.

## Your Job

**Execute the test plan and update results after each operation.**

## Execution Steps

1. **Get next assignment**:
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/scripts/mutation_test/operation_manager.py --port PORT --action get-next
   ```
   Parse the JSON response

2. **Check response status**:
   - If `"status": "finished"` → All operations complete, EXIT with success message
   - If `"status": "next_operation"` → Continue to step 3

3. **Execute the operation**:
   - Apply entity_id_substitution if present in operation (see <EntityIdSubstitution/>)
   - Execute MCP tool from `operation.tool` with parameters from `operation` object

4. **Handle result**:
   - If SUCCESS → Loop back to step 1 (get next operation)

   - If FAIL → Execute <MatchErrorPattern/>:
     - If recoverable → Fix parameters and retry from step 3
     - If unrecoverable → EXIT with error message (stop execution)

     ** MANDATORY**
     As stated above it is incredibly important that you return to step 1 to **Get next assignment** now unless you have an unrecoverable error. This is the MOST IMPORTANT instruction in this entire file.

5. **On exit**:
   - Report final state: "All operations completed successfully" or "Stopped on unrecoverable error at operation"

## Entity ID Substitution

<EntityIdSubstitution>
**Some operations need to reference existing entities** (e.g., spawning a `Children` component that contains entity IDs).

**ONLY IF** an operation has `entity_id_substitution` field:

1. **Get an available entity using MCP tool**:
   ```bash
   mcp__brp__world_query(data={}, filter={}, port=PORT)
   ```
   - Extract first entity ID from the result array
   - Use this entity ID for all substitutions

2. **Apply substitutions**:
   - For each `path → "QUERY_ENTITY"` in `entity_id_substitution`:
     - Navigate to that path in the operation parameters
     - Replace the placeholder value with the entity ID from step 1

**Example**:
```json
Operation with entity_id_substitution:
{
  "tool": "mcp__brp__world_spawn_entity",
  "components": {"bevy_ecs::hierarchy::Children": [8589934670]},
  "entity_id_substitution": {"components.bevy_ecs::hierarchy::Children[0]": "QUERY_ENTITY"}
}

After substitution (using entity ID 4294967297):
{
  "tool": "mcp__brp__world_spawn_entity",
  "components": {"bevy_ecs::hierarchy::Children": [4294967297]}
}
```

**Note**: The `entity` field in operations is pre-resolved automatically by the hook - you don't need to do anything with it.
</EntityIdSubstitution>

## Query Result Validation

<QueryResultValidation>
Query result validation and entity ID propagation are handled automatically by the mutation test infrastructure.

When you execute `mcp__brp__world_query`, the post-tool hook will:
- Extract entities from the query result
- If entities found:
  - Add `"entity"` field to the query operation in the test plan
  - **Propagate the entity ID to all subsequent operations in the same test** that have `"entity": "USE_QUERY_RESULT"`
- If no entities found: Mark the query as FAIL with error "Query returned 0 entities"

**Your responsibility**: Just execute the query operation. If it fails (status = FAIL), stop execution immediately per the normal error handling rules in <OperationExecution/>.

**Note**: You don't need to validate query results, propagate entity IDs, or look back at previous operations - the hook handles all of this automatically. Entity IDs are isolated to each test (don't cross type boundaries).
</QueryResultValidation>

## Error Pattern Matching

<MatchErrorPattern>
**When an operation fails, check the error message against these patterns IN THIS EXACT ORDER:**

Does error contain `"invalid type: string"`?
- ✓ YES → Execute <InvalidTypeStringError/> recovery
- ✗ NO → Continue

Does error start with `"UUID parsing failed"`?
- ✓ YES → Execute <UuidParsingError/> recovery
- ✗ NO → Continue

Does error contain `"Unable to extract parameters"`?
- ✓ YES → Execute <ParameterExtractionError/> recovery
- ✗ NO → Continue

Does error contain `"invalid type: null"`?
- ✓ YES → Execute <UnitEnumVariantError/> recovery
- ✗ NO → Continue

Does error contain `"unknown variant"` with escaped quotes (like `\"VariantName\"`)?
- ✓ YES → Check the test plan JSON for the original `value` field:
  - If it was a plain string (like "None" or "Low") → Execute <UnitEnumVariantError/> recovery
  - Otherwise → Execute <EnumVariantError/> recovery
- ✗ NO → Continue

**No pattern matched:**
- No recovery available
- STOP IMMEDIATELY - do not process remaining operations
</MatchErrorPattern>

<InvalidTypeStringError>
**Pattern**: Error contains `"invalid type: string"`

**Cause**: You sent a number/boolean as a string (YOUR bug, not BRP's)

**Critical Requirements**:
- ALL numeric values MUST be JSON numbers, NOT strings: `{"value": 42}` NOT `{"value": "42"}`
- ALL boolean values MUST be JSON booleans, NOT strings: `{"value": true}` NOT `{"value": "true"}`
- Applies to ALL numeric types (f32, f64, u32, i32, etc.) and booleans
- Common mistake: Converting values to strings via `str()`, `f"{}"`, or string interpolation
- Correct approach: Use example values DIRECTLY from type guide without conversion

**Recovery**:
1. Parse error to identify which parameter has the wrong type
2. Convert to proper JSON type (remove quotes from primitives)
3. Re-execute operation with corrected value
5. DO NOT report as test failure - this is YOUR bug, not BRP's
6. Only fail if retry produces DIFFERENT error

**Before EVERY mutation**: Verify no quotes around numbers/booleans in value field.
</InvalidTypeStringError>

<UnitEnumVariantError>
**Pattern**: Error contains `"unknown variant"` with escaped quotes, AND test plan has plain string value

**Cause**: You're double quoting a string turning "Low" into "\"Low\"" - this is breaking things.

**Recovery**:
1. Re-read operation's `value` field from test plan JSON
2. Pass it AS-IS to MCP tool without ANY transformation
3. Re-execute operation
5. DO NOT report as test failure - this is YOUR bug

**Examples**:
- ✓ CORRECT: Pass `"None"` as string
- ✗ WRONG: Convert to `null` or add quotes
</UnitEnumVariantError>

<UuidParsingError>
**Pattern**: Error message starts with `"UUID parsing failed"`

**Full error example**:
```
UUID parsing failed: invalid character: expected an optional prefix of `urn:uuid:` followed by [0-9a-fA-F-], found `\"` at 1
```

**Cause**: You double-quoted a UUID string

**Recovery**:
1. Find UUID value in operation params
2. Remove extra quotes: `"\"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\""` → `"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"`
3. Re-execute operation
</UuidParsingError>

<EnumVariantError>
**Pattern**: Error contains `"unknown variant"` with escaped quotes like `\"VariantName\"`

**Cause**: You double-quoted an enum variant

**Recovery**:
1. Remove extra quotes: `"\"Low\""` → `"Low"`
2. Re-execute operation
4. DO NOT report as test failure - this is YOUR bug
</EnumVariantError>

<ParameterExtractionError>
**Pattern**: Error contains `"Unable to extract parameters"`

**Cause**: Tool framework issue with parameter order

**Recovery**:
1. Reorder parameters in your tool call (change the order you pass them)
2. Re-execute operation with reordered parameters
</ParameterExtractionError>
