# Unified query result validation script
# Usage: query_validate.sh <command> <result_file> [args...]
#
# Commands:
#   has_entity <entity_id>                    - Check entity exists
#   has_component <entity_id> <component>     - Check entity has component
#   no_component <entity_id> <component>      - Check entity lacks component
#   count_entities                             - Print entity count
#   entity_ids_only                            - Check results are entity IDs only (no component data)
#   has_camera_excluded                        - Check no Camera entities in results
#   validate_all_query                         - Verify "all" query returns entities with multiple components
#   validate_name_filter                       - Verify all entities have Name component and multiple components
