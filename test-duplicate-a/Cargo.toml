# TEST INFRASTRUCTURE - DO NOT MODIFY DEPENDENCY DECLARATIONS
#
# This directory exists to test path disambiguation when multiple apps have the same name.
# Both test-duplicate-a and test-duplicate-b contain an app named `test_duplicate_app`,
# which tests the MCP's ability to handle duplicates via the `path` parameter.
#
# This directory is EXCLUDED from the parent workspace (see root Cargo.toml exclude list).
# The exclusion tests that MCP's recursive discovery can find apps beyond workspace members.
#
# CRITICAL: Dependencies MUST use explicit versions (e.g., version = "0.17.2").
# DO NOT use `workspace = true` - excluded directories cannot access workspace dependencies,
# which causes `cargo metadata` to fail, making these apps invisible to MCP discovery.
# This will break both the `list` and `path` integration tests.
