# Expected Changes in Mutation Test JSON

This file documents expected changes between baseline and current mutation test JSON files that occur due to intentional refactoring. These changes should be recognized and grouped separately from unexpected changes during comparison.

## Expected Change #1: Removal of "variants" Arrays from Mutation Paths

### Description
The refactoring in commit 7db229f removed "variants" arrays from individual field-level mutation paths. These arrays previously indicated which enum variant owned each field (e.g., "LinearRgba" for color fields).

### Structural Change
**Removed**: "variants" field from all field-level mutation paths

### When Comparison Output Says:
```
üìå IDENTIFIED PATTERN: FIELD REMOVED
Fields removed breakdown:
  ‚Ä¢ 'variants' field: 874 removal(s) across 57 type(s)
```

**This is talking about**: The removal of "variants" arrays from mutation paths, which is EXPECTED.

### Example: bevy_sprite::sprite::Sprite

#### BASELINE (from get_guide.sh)
```json
".color.0.blue": {
  "description": "Mutate the blue field of LinearRgba",
  "example": 3.1415927410125732,
  "path_info": {
    "mutation_status": "mutable",
    "path_kind": "StructField",
    "type": "f32",
    "type_kind": "Value"
  },
  "variants": ["LinearRgba"]  // <-- HAD THIS
}
```

#### CURRENT (from live type guide)
```json
".color.0.blue": {
  "description": "Mutate the blue field of Srgba",
  "example": 3.1415927410125732,
  "path_info": {
    "mutation_status": "mutable",
    "path_kind": "StructField",
    "type": "f32",
    "type_kind": "Value"
  }
  // NO "variants" field
}
```

<HowToIdentify>
To identify this change pattern in the comparison output:

1. Look for FIELD REMOVED pattern with:
   - 'variants' field: 800+ removals across 50+ types

2. This is the EXACT line to match:
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ 'variants' field: [NUMBER] removal(s) across [NUMBER] type(s)
   ```

3. Any "variants" field removal count above 800 should be considered this expected change.

This is an EXPECTED change from the enum variant optimization refactoring and should not be flagged as an error.

## Expected Change #2: Removal of "enum_info" Field from Enum Types

### Description
The "enum_info" field has been removed from the root level of enum types. This field previously contained variant information that has been restructured in the current implementation.

### Structural Change
**Removed**: "enum_info" field from root level of enum types

### When Comparison Output Says:
```
üìå IDENTIFIED PATTERN: FIELD REMOVED
Fields removed breakdown:
  ‚Ä¢ 'enum_info' field: 18 removal(s) across 18 type(s)
```

**This is talking about**: The removal of "enum_info" field from enum types, which is EXPECTED.

### Example: bevy_sprite::sprite::Anchor

#### BASELINE
```json
{
  "type_name": "bevy_sprite::sprite::Anchor",
  "enum_info": [
    {
      "variant_name": "Center",
      "fields": []
    },
    {
      "variant_name": "BottomLeft",
      "fields": []
    }
    // ... more variants
  ],
  "mutation_paths": {
    // ... mutation paths
  }
}
```

#### CURRENT
```json
{
  "type_name": "bevy_sprite::sprite::Anchor",
  // NO "enum_info" field
  "mutation_paths": {
    // ... mutation paths
  }
}
```

<HowToIdentify>
To identify this change pattern in the comparison output:

1. Look for FIELD REMOVED pattern with:
   - 'enum_info' field: removals from type root paths

2. This is the EXACT line to match:
   ```
   ‚Ä¢ 'enum_info' field: [NUMBER] removal(s) across [NUMBER] type(s)
   ```

3. The path for these removals will be at the root level (empty path or just the type name)

This is an EXPECTED change from refactoring how enum variant information is stored and should not be flagged as an error.
</HowToIdentify>

## Expected Change #3: Addition of "path_requirement" to Variant-Dependent Mutation Paths

### Description
The variant path structure implementation (commit 1cad13c) added "path_requirement" information to mutation paths that depend on specific enum variants being active. This provides explicit tracking of variant dependencies for each mutation path.

### Structural Change
**Added**: "path_requirement" field within "path_info" for variant-dependent paths

### When Comparison Output Says:
```
üìå IDENTIFIED PATTERN: VALUE CHANGE
Types affected: 78
Total changes: 1100+
```

**This is talking about**: The addition of path_requirement structures to path_info, which is EXPECTED.

### Example: extras_plugin::TestEnumWithSerDe

#### BASELINE
```json
".1": {
  "description": "Mutate element 1 of TestEnumWithSerDe",
  "example": 1000000,
  "path_info": {
    "mutation_status": "mutable",
    "path_kind": "IndexedElement",
    "type": "u32",
    "type_kind": "Value"
  },
  "variants": ["Special"]
}
```

#### CURRENT
```json
".1": {
  "description": "Mutate element 1 of TestEnumWithSerDe",
  "example": 1000000,
  "path_info": {
    "mutation_status": "mutable",
    "path_kind": "IndexedElement",
    "path_requirement": {  // <-- NEW FIELD
      "description": "To use this mutation path, root must be set to TestEnumWithSerDe::TestEnumWithSerDe::Special",
      "example": 1000000,
      "variant_path": [
        {
          "path": "",
          "variant": "TestEnumWithSerDe::TestEnumWithSerDe::Special"
        }
      ]
    },
    "type": "u32",
    "type_kind": "Value"
  }
  // NO "variants" field (removed as per Expected Change #1)
}
```

<HowToIdentify>
To identify this change pattern in the comparison output:

1. Look for VALUE CHANGE pattern with:
   - Large number of changes (1000+) in path_info fields
   - References to "path_requirement" in the change descriptions

2. Key characteristics:
   - path_info objects gain a new "path_requirement" field
   - The path_requirement contains:
     - "description": explaining variant requirements
     - "example": the example value for this path
     - "variant_path": array of path/variant pairs showing dependencies
   - This replaces the simpler "variants" array approach

3. This change often appears alongside Expected Change #1 (removal of "variants" arrays)

This is an EXPECTED change from the variant path structure implementation that provides better tracking of enum variant dependencies for mutation paths.
</HowToIdentify>

## Expected Change #4: Addition of extras_plugin::NestedConfigEnum Test Type

### Description
A new test enum type `extras_plugin::NestedConfigEnum` was added to the extras_plugin test app to validate nested enum handling in the variant path structure implementation.

### Structural Change
**Added**: New type `extras_plugin::NestedConfigEnum` in the type registry

### When Comparison Output Says:
```
üîç TYPE-LEVEL CHANGES
   ‚îú‚îÄ New Types: 1
   ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ extras_plugin::NestedConfigEnum
```

**This is talking about**: The addition of the NestedConfigEnum test type, which is EXPECTED.

### Type Characteristics
```json
{
  "spawn_format": {
    "Conditional": [1000000]
  },
  "supported_operations": ["query", "get", "spawn", "insert", "mutate"],
  "mutation_path_count": 2
}
```

<HowToIdentify>
To identify this change pattern in the comparison output:

1. Look for TYPE-LEVEL CHANGES with:
   - New Types: 1
   - Specifically mentions `extras_plugin::NestedConfigEnum`

2. This is the EXACT line to match:
   ```
   ‚îú‚îÄ extras_plugin::NestedConfigEnum
   ```

3. Key characteristics:
   - It's a test type in the extras_plugin
   - Used for validating nested enum configurations
   - Has a tuple variant "Conditional" with a u32 parameter

This is an EXPECTED addition for testing the variant path structure implementation and nested enum handling.
