//! Flow control types for the format discovery system
//!
//! This module defines the core result types that control the flow between
//! normal BRP execution (Phase 0) and the format error recovery system (exception path).
//!
//! # Architecture Overview
//!
//! The format discovery system operates in two distinct phases:
//!
//! ## Phase 0: Normal Path
//! Direct BRP execution without format discovery overhead. Most requests succeed here.
//!
//! ## Exception Path: Format Error Recovery
//! When Phase 0 fails with format errors, the system enters a 3-level decision tree:
//! - Level 1: Registry/serialization checks
//! - Level 2: Direct discovery via `bevy_brp_extras`
//! - Level 3: Pattern-based transformations

    /// Correction was successfully applied
    Corrected { correction_info: CorrectionInfo },
