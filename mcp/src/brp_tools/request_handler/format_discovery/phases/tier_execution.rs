//! Tier execution phase for the format discovery engine
//!
//! This module previously contained legacy tier-based execution logic.
//! All functionality has been moved to the recovery engine with its 3-level architecture.

// All the legacy tier-based functions have been removed in Phase 4
// The functionality is now handled by the recovery engine and its
// three levels: registry checks, direct discovery, and pattern transformations
