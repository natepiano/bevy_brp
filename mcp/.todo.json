The new generic DataField extractor handles all cases with a single closure.\n\n2. COMPLEXITY: The refactored solution is simpler - one generic closure replaces 22 specialized functions. The convert_extractor_type function remains readable despite Box wrapping.\n\n3. PLAN VALIDATION: The plan was successfully executed with one modification - changed FieldExtractor from function pointer to Box<dyn Fn> trait object to support closures. This was necessary and appropriate.\n\n4. ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS: Used Arc for FormatterConfig to avoid Clone issues with trait objects. Added appropriate clippy allow for false positive const fn lint.\n\n5. QUALITY: All tests pass (144/144), no compiler warnings, clippy clean, properly formatted.\n\nThe refactoring achieves the goal of reducing code duplication while maintaining functionality and type safety."
