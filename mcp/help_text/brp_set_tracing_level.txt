Set the tracing level for comprehensive BRP diagnostic logging to file.

Tracing levels (from least to most verbose):
- error: Only error messages
- warn: Warnings and errors  
- info: General information, warnings, and errors (default)
- debug: Debug information plus all above levels
- trace: Most detailed tracing plus all above levels

All tracing output is written to 'bevy_brp_mcp_trace.log' in the system temp directory. The file-based logging allows detailed diagnostic information without cluttering the MCP response stream.


This is particularly useful for troubleshooting BRP operations, understanding request processing pipelines, and diagnosing parameter parsing or method resolution issues.
