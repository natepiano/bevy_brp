Set the tracing level for comprehensive BRP diagnostic logging to file.

Tracing levels (from least to most verbose):
- error
- warn (default)
- info
- debug
- trace

All tracing output is written to 'bevy_brp_mcp_trace.log' in the system temp directory. The file-based logging allows detailed diagnostic information without cluttering the MCP response stream.

Every new session sets the tracing level back to default
