Launches Bevy apps in detached mode with asset loading support, automatic logging, and proper CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR setup.

Features: Non-blocking execution, temp directory logs, debug/release profiles, multi-instance support.

Multi-instance launching:
- When instance_count > 1, launches multiple instances on sequential ports
- Example: port=15702, instance_count=3 launches on ports 15702, 15703, 15704
- Each instance gets its own log file with port in filename
- Useful for parallel testing and load simulation

Notes:
- App must be built first. Check with list_bevy_apps. View logs with list_logs/read_log.
- If multiple apps with the same name exist in different paths, you must specify the path parameter. The error message will list available paths.
- Path matching supports: full relative paths (e.g., "bevy_brp/my-app"), partial paths (e.g., "my-app"), or workspace names for disambiguation.
- When specifying a port, bevy_brp_extras is required to support listening on the environment variable `BRP_EXTRAS_PORT`.
