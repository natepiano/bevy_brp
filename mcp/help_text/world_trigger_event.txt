Triggers an event in the Bevy world. This allows remote triggering of game events like spawning enemies, changing game state, or triggering cutscenes.

## Requirements

Events must be registered with reflection to be triggerable:

```rust
#[derive(Event, Reflect)]
#[reflect(Event)]
pub struct SpawnEnemy {
    pub enemy_type: String,
    pub position: Vec3,
}

// In your app setup:
app.register_type::<SpawnEnemy>();
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `event` | string | Yes | Full type path of the event (e.g., "my_game::SpawnEnemy") |
| `value` | object | No | Event payload as JSON. Omit for unit events (events with no data). |
| `port` | number | No | BRP port (default: 15702) |

## Examples

### Unit Event (no payload)

Trigger a simple event with no data:

```json
{
  "event": "my_game::events::PauseGame"
}
```

### Event with Payload

Trigger an event with structured data:

```json
{
  "event": "my_game::events::SpawnEnemy",
  "value": {
    "enemy_type": "goblin",
    "position": [10.0, 0.0, 5.0]
  }
}
```

### Event with Entity Reference

Events can reference entities:

```json
{
  "event": "my_game::events::DamageEntity",
  "value": {
    "target": 4294967299,
    "amount": 50
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| "Unknown event type" | Event type not registered in the type registry |
| "Event is not reflectable" | Event missing `#[reflect(Event)]` attribute |
| "is invalid" | Payload doesn't match expected event structure |

## Notes

- Events are triggered globally via `World::trigger()`, not targeted at specific entities
- The event must have `#[reflect(Event)]` to be discoverable and triggerable
- Use `brp_type_guide` or `registry_schema` to discover available event types
