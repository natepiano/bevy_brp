Types text sequentially in Bevy apps via bevy_brp_extras. Characters are typed one per frame with proper key press/release cycles, simulating realistic human typing.

Unlike `send_keys` which sends all keys simultaneously (for chords and shortcuts), `type_text` queues characters and types them sequentially. This is ideal for text input fields that need to process each character individually.

Supported characters:
- Letters (a-z, A-Z) - uppercase uses Shift
- Digits (0-9)
- Common symbols (!@#$%^&*()-=_+[]{}|;':",.<>/?\`~)
- Whitespace (space, newline, tab)

Characters that cannot be mapped will be skipped and reported in the response.

Examples:
```json
{"text": "hello world"}           // Types 11 characters across 11 frames
{"text": "Hello, World!\n"}       // Mixed case with punctuation and newline
{"text": "test@example.com"}      // Email address with @ symbol
```

Prerequisites: bevy_brp_extras dependency and BrpExtrasPlugin registered.
