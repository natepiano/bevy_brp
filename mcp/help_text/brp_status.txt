Check if a Bevy app is running with BRP enabled to verify app status, confirm BRP connectivity, troubleshoot connection issues, or get process information.

Return status values:
- "running_with_brp": App running with BRP responding
- "running_no_brp": App running but BRP not responding (check RemotePlugin)
- "brp_found_app_not_detected": BRP responds but app process not detected (different build profile?)
- "not_running": App not running

Response includes:
- status: One of above values
- app_name: Checked app name
- port: Checked port
- app_running: Boolean if app process detected
- brp_responsive: Boolean if BRP responded
- pid: Process ID if detected (null otherwise)

IMPORTANT: Requires RemotePlugin in Bevy app plugin configuration.
