Capture screenshots from running Bevy applications using bevy_brp_extras for debugging, documentation, automated testing, or building screenshot-based testing workflows.

Behavior:
- Captures current frame via bevy_brp_extras/screenshot
- Saves to specified path
- Supports common image formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- Path must be writable by Bevy application

Returns:
- status: "success" or "error"
- path: File path where saved
- port: Port used
- message: Result description

Prerequisites:
- bevy_brp_extras dependency required
- BrpExtrasPlugin must be registered
- Camera and rendering pipeline must be active

IMPORTANT: Requires bevy_brp_extras - standard BRP alone won't work.
