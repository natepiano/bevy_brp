Get type schemas for all registered types in a running Bevy application.

This tool combines the functionality of bevy/list and brp_type_schema to fetch schemas for all registered component types in a single convenient call. It's particularly useful for coding agents to discover all available types and their formats without multiple round trips.

The tool:
1. Calls bevy/list without an entity parameter to get all registered types
2. Uses the TypeSchemaEngine to fetch the complete registry
3. Generates type schema information for every registered type

Returns comprehensive type information including:
- spawn_format: Example JSON structure for bevy/spawn, bevy/insert and bevy/insert_resource operations
- mutation_info: Available mutation paths for bevy/mutate_component and bevy/mutate_resource operations
- supported_operations: Which BRP operations work with each type
- reflection_traits: Serialization capabilities (Serialize, Deserialize, etc.)

This is especially useful for:
- Initial exploration of a Bevy app's type system
- Generating comprehensive type documentation
- Building tooling that needs to understand all available types
- Avoiding the slower workflow of calling bevy/list then brp_type_schema separately
