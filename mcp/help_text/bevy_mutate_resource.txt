Mutates resource fields via bevy/mutate_resource BRP method. Updates specific fields without replacing entire resource.

Path syntax:
- Root replacement: "" (empty string to replace entire resource)
- Nested: ".config.graphics.resolution"
- Arrays: ".items[0]"
- Maps: ".scores['player1']"
- Tuples: ".0", ".1"
- Leading dot required for field paths

Example:
```json
{
  "resource": "my_game::config::GameConfig",
  "path": ".settings.sound.volume",
  "value": 0.5
}
```

Benefits: Preserves other fields, efficient for large resources, safer for concurrent mods.
Note: Requires reflection support.
