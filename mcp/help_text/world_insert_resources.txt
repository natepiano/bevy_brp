Inserts/updates resources via world.insert_resources BRP method. Useful for modifying config, injecting data, testing states, and building tools.

Example:
```json
{
  "resource": "my_game::config::GameConfig",
  "value": {
    "difficulty": "hard",
    "sound_volume": 0.8,
    "graphics_quality": "high"
  }
}
```

Behavior: Replaces existing resources, creates if missing.
Note: Requires resource to be registered with BRP and have the Reflect trait
