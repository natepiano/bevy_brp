- fps.history_duration_secs: Time span covered by the history buffer
- frame_time_ms.current: Most recent frame time in milliseconds
- frame_time_ms.average: Average frame time over the history buffer
- frame_time_ms.smoothed: Exponentially smoothed frame time
- frame_count: Total frames since application start
