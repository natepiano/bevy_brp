Launches Bevy apps in detached mode with asset loading support, automatic logging, and proper CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR setup.

Parameters:
- app_name (required): Name of Bevy app to launch
- profile (optional): Build profile - "debug" (default) or "release"
- path (optional): Path to use when multiple apps with the same name exist (supports full paths, partial paths, or workspace names)
- port (optional): BRP port to use (default: 15702)

Features: Non-blocking execution, temp directory logs, debug/release profiles.

Notes:
- App must be built first. Check with list_bevy_apps. View logs with list_logs/read_log.
- If multiple apps with the same name exist in different paths, you must specify the path parameter. The error message will list available paths.
- Path matching supports: full relative paths (e.g., "bevy_brp/my-app"), partial paths (e.g., "my-app"), or workspace names for disambiguation.
- When specifying a port, bevy_brp_extras is required to support listening on the environment variable `BRP_PORT`.
