Gracefully shutdown running Bevy applications for proper resource cleanup, stopping resource-blocking apps, testing shutdown behavior, or managing app lifecycle.

Parameters:
- app_name (required): Name of Bevy app to shutdown
- port (optional): BRP port

Shutdown behavior:
1. Attempts bevy_brp_extras/shutdown for clean shutdown
2. Falls back to process termination if unavailable
3. Reports method used in response

Returns:
- status: "success" or "error"
- method: "clean_shutdown" or "process_kill"
- app_name: Target app name
- port: Port used
- message: Result description

For clean shutdown support, add bevy_brp_extras dependency and register BrpExtrasPlugin.

IMPORTANT: Process termination prevents cleanup and may leave resources inconsistent.
