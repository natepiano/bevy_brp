Provides guidance to the coding agent for working with bevy components and resources.

This tool spawn/insert/mutate information for types in your Bevy app so that your coding agent can construct the necessary JSON structures for BRP operations.

Returns:
- spawn_example / resource_example: Example JSON structure for `world.spawn_entity` operations, `world.insert_components` and `world.insert_resources` methods.
- mutation_info: Available mutation paths for `world.mutate_components` and `world.mutate_resources` operations
- schema_info.reflect_types: Array of reflection traits on this type (Component, Resource, Serialize, Deserialize, Default, etc.)

Check schema_info.reflect_types array to determine type capabilities:
- Contains "Component" → supports Query, Get, Spawn, Insert operations (+ Mutate if mutable fields exist)
- Contains "Resource" → supports Query, Get, Insert operations (+ Mutate if mutable fields exist)
