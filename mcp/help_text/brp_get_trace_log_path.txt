Get the path to the BRP diagnostic trace log file. Useful only for debugging the mcp tool itself. You have to have trace logs in the code for anything to show up here.

Returns information about the trace log file including:
- log_path:
- exists:
- file_size_bytes:

The log file is created automatically when tracing level is set via `mcp__brp__brp_set_tracing_level`.
