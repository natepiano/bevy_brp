Changes entity parents via bevy/reparent BRP method. Useful for reorganizing hierarchies, drag-and-drop, scene graphs, and dynamic attachment.

Examples:
```json
{"entities": [123, 124, 125], "parent": 100}
```
Remove parent:
```json
{"entities": [123, 124, 125]}
```

Behavior: Replaces parent relationships, updates transform hierarchies.
Notes: Parent must exist, no circular hierarchies allowed.
Important: Entities need Transform components for spatial hierarchies.
