Launch a Bevy application by name.

The launch tool finds and starts a Bevy app, returning the port it's running on
for subsequent BRP commands.

Parameters:
- app_name: The name of the Bevy app to launch (required)
- profile: Build profile to use - "debug" (default) or "release" (optional)

The tool will:
1. Use cargo metadata to find the app binary
2. Launch the app with bevy_remote enabled
3. Wait for the app to be ready
4. Return the BRP port for communication

Examples:
- launch("my_game") - Launches in debug mode
- launch("my_game", "release") - Launches optimized release build
