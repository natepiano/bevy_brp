Bevy Remote Protocol (BRP) MCP server for interacting with Bevy applications.

This server allows you to interact with Bevy apps by name. Simply provide the app name, 
and the server will:
- Check if the app is already running
- Find the app binary if not running
- Launch the app if requested
- Execute BRP commands against the running app

Common usage patterns:
- "launch my_game" - Launches the app in debug mode
- "launch my_game with release profile" - Launches in release mode

The server uses cargo metadata to find Bevy apps in your workspace and handles
connection management automatically.
