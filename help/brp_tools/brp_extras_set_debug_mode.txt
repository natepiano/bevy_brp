Enable or disable debug mode in bevy_brp_extras to see detailed format discovery information.

This tool specifically controls debug output from the bevy_brp_extras crate's discovery
functions. Use this when you want to see detailed information about format discovery
without the additional tier and routing information from bevy_brp_mcp.

When to use this tool vs brp_set_debug_mode:
- Use brp_extras_set_debug_mode: When debugging format discovery issues within bevy_brp_extras
- Use brp_set_debug_mode: When debugging the full discovery pipeline including tier attempts

Parameters:
- enabled (required): Set to true to enable debug output, false to disable

Note: This only affects debug output from bevy_brp_extras discover_format calls.
It does not affect bevy_brp_mcp's debug output.
